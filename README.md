**Project Description:**  
This repository focuses on developing firmware and signal-processing filters for the STM32 G474RE microcontroller to accurately measure and analyze three-axis inertial data (X, Y, and Z).

**Key Features:**
- **Multidimensional Measurements:** Acquire raw accelerometer and gyroscope data across all three axes for comprehensive motion analysis.
- **Firmware Development:** Implement robust and efficient embedded firmware tailored to the STM32 G474RE platform.
- **Signal Filtering & Calibration:** Apply advanced filtering techniques (e.g., complementary, Kalman, or low-pass filters) to enhance data quality and reduce noise.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Achieve low-latency measurements suitable for closed-loop control systems and high-performance robotics applications.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Easily integrate additional sensors or modules without major changes to the core firmware structure.
- **Modular Codebase:** Organized and maintainable code that follows industry best practices, making it straightforward to adapt for future sensor configurations.
- **Documentation & Examples:** Include detailed documentation, usage guides, and sample code to help users quickly get started and understand the systemâ€™s capabilities.
- **Testing & Validation:** Incorporate unit tests, integration tests, and hardware-in-the-loop testing to ensure reliability and accuracy.
